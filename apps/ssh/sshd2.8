.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B Sshd2 
(Secure Shell Daemon) is the daemon program for 
.BR ssh2 ".
Together these programs replace rlogin and rsh programs, and
provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts
over an insecure network.  The programs are intended to be as easy to
install and use as possible.
.LP
.B Sshd2 
is normally started at boot from 
.I /etc/rc.local
or equivalent.  It forks a new
daemon for each incoming connection.  The forked daemons handle
key exchange, encryption, authentication, command execution,
and data exchange.
.LP
.B Sshd2 
can be configured using command-line options or a configuration
file.  Command-line options override values specified in the
configuration file.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d \ debug_level_spec
Debug mode.  The server sends verbose debug output to stderr.
This option is only intended for debugging for the server.  The
debugging level is either a number, or a comma-separated list of
assignments "ModulePattern=debug_level".
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-f \ configuration_file
Specifies the name of the configuration file.  The default is
.IR /etc/ssh2/sshd2_config ".
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-h \ host_key_file
Specifies the file from which the host key is read (default
.IR /etc/ssh2/hostkey).  
If sshd2 is not run as root, the default host key file will be
.IR $HOME$/.ssh2/hostkey.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-o \ 'option'
Can be used to give options in the format used in the
configuration files.  This is useful for specifying options for
which there is no separate command-line flag.  The option has the
same format as a line in the configuration file.  Comment lines
are not currently accepted.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-p \ port
Specifies the port on which the server listens for connections
(default is 22).
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-v
Enable verbose mode. Display verbose debugging mssages. Equal to
`-d 2'. This option can also be specified in the configuration file.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-q
Quiet mode.  Nothing is sent to the system log.  Normally the
beginning, authentication, and termination of each connection is
logged. This option can also be specified in the configuration
file. (logging not implemented yet.)
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-g \ login_grace_time
Gives the grace time for clients to authenticate themselves (default
600 seconds).  If the client fails to authenticate the user within
this many seconds, the server disconnects and exits.  A value of zero
indicates no limit. (not yet implemented)
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-i
Specifies that sshd is being run from inetd.
.ne 3

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

.B Sshd2
reads configuration data from 
.I /etc/ssh2/sshd2_config
(or the file specified with -f on the command line).  The file
contains keyword-value pairs, one per line.  Lines starting with \'#\'
and empty lines are interpreted as comments.

The following keywords are possible. Keywords are case insensitive. 
.TP
.de YN
"\fByes\fR" or "\fBno\fR".
..

.B ForwardAgent
Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if
any) will be forwarded to the remote machine. The argument must
be
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B ForwardX11
Specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically
redirected over the secure channel and DISPLAY set. The argument
must be
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B PasswordAuthentication
Specifies whether to use password authentication. The argument
must be
.YN  
.ne 3
.TP
.B RHostsAuthentication
Specifies whether authentication using rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv
files is sufficient.  Normally, this method should not be permitted
because it is insecure.  RhostsPubKeyAuthentication should be used
instead, because it performs RSA-based host authentication in addition
to normal rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv authentication.
The argument must be
.YN
(not yet implemented)
.ne 3
.TP
.B RHostsPubKeyAuthentication 
Specifies whether rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv authentication
together with successful publickey host authentication is
allowed.
.B RHostsRSAAuthentication 
is a synonym for this keyword, and it is defined for backwards
compatibility with
.B ssh1\fR. 
The argument must be
.YN
(not yet implemented)  
.ne 3
.TP
.B PubKeyAuthentication
Specifies whether to try public key authentication.
.B RSAAuthentication
is a synonym for this keyword, and it is defined for backwards
compatibility with
.B ssh1\fR.
The argument must be
.YN  
.ne 3
.TP
.B Port
Specifies the port number that
.B sshd2
listens on.  The current default is 22.
.ne 3
.TP
.B Ciphers
Specifies the ciphers to use for encrypting the
session. Currently, 
.\" XXX Could this be made dist-dependent ?
.IR des ",
.IR 3des ",
.IR blowfish ", 
.IR idea
and 
.IR arcfour
are supported, of which
.IR des ",
.IR 3des
and
.IR arcfour
are in all distributions. Multiple ciphers can be specified as a
comma-separated list.  Special values to this option are
.IR any ",
.IR anystd ",
that allows only standard (see below) ciphers, and
.IR anycipher
that allows either any available cipher or excludes nonencrypting
cipher mode
.IR none
but allows all others.
.IR anystdcipher
is the same as above, but includes only those ciphers mentioned in the
IETF-SecSH-draft (excluding 'none').
.ne 3
.TP 
.B AuthorizationFile
Specifies the name of the user's authorization file.
.ne 3
.TP
.B RandomSeedFile
Specifies the name of the randomseed file.
.ne 3
.TP
.\" What does the server do with this?
.B ForcePTTYAllocation
For tty allocation, ie. allocate a tty even if a command is
given. The argument must be
.YN
(not yet implemented)
.ne 3
.TP
.B VerboseMode
Verbose mode.  Causes 
.B sshd2 
to print debugging messages about its
progress. This is helpful in debugging connection,
authentication, and configuration problems.
.ne 3
.TP
.B QuietMode
Specifies whether the system runs in quiet mode.  In quiet mode,
nothing is logged in the system log, except fatal errors.  The
argument must be
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B KeepAlive
Specifies whether the system should send keepalive messages to
the other side.  If they are sent, death of the connection or
crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  However,
this means that connections will die if the route is down
temporarily, and some people find it annoying. On the other hand,
if keepalives are not send, sessions may hang indefinitely on the
server, leaving "ghost" users and consuming server resources.

The default is "\fByes\fR" (to send keepalives), and the server
will notice if the network goes down or the client host reboots.
This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.

To disable keepalives, the value should be set to "\fBno\fR" in
both the server and the client configuration files.  (not yet
implemented)
.ne 3
.TP
.B IgnoreRhosts
Specifies that rhosts and shosts files will not be used in
authentication.
.I /etc/hosts.equiv
and
.I /etc/shosts.equiv 
are still used.  (not yet implemented)
.ne 3
.TP
.B PermitRootLogin
Specifies whether the root can log in using
.BR ssh2 .
.\"May be set to "yes", "nopwd", or "no".  The default is "yes", allowing
.\"root logins through any of the authentication types allowed for other
.\"users.  The "nopwd" value disables password-authenticated root logins.
.\"The "no" value disables root logins through any of the authentication
.\"methods.  ("nopwd" and "no" are equivalent unless you have
.\"a .rhosts, .shosts, or .ssh/authorized_keys file in the root home
.\"directory.)
.\"
.\"Root login with RSA authentication when the "command" option has been
.\"specified will be allowed regardless of the value of this setting
.\"(which may be useful for taking remote backups even if root login is
.\"normally not allowed).
The default is "\fByes\fR".The argument must be
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B PermitEmptyPasswords
When password authentication is allowed, it specifies whether the
server allows login to accounts with empty password strings. The
argument must be
.YN (not yet implemented)
.ne 3
.TP
.B StrictModes
Specifies whether 
.B sshd2 
should check file modes and ownership of the user's home directory and
rhosts files before accepting login.  This is normally desirable because
novices sometimes accidentally leave their directory or files
world-writable. The default is "\fByes\fR". The argument must be
.YN (not yet implemented)
.ne 3
.TP
.B PrintMotd
Specifies whether
.B sshd2
should print 
.I /etc/motd
when a user logs in interactively. The default
is "\fByes\fR".  The argument must be
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B ListenAddress
Specifies the ip address of the interface where the
.B sshd2 
server socket is bind.
.ne 3
.TP
.B HostKeyFile
Specifies the file containing the private host key (default
.IR /etc/ssh2/hostkey ").
.ne 3
.TP
.B PublicHostKeyFile
Specifies the file containing the public host key (default
.IR /etc/ssh2/hostkey.pub ").
Note: In most cases the order of config parameters isn't an
issue. Here it is safe if you specify HostKeyFile first before
this parameter.
.ne 3
.TP
.B LoginGraceTime
The server disconnects after this time if the user has not
successfully logged in.  If the value is 0, there is no time limit.
The default is 600 (seconds). (not yet implemented)
.ne 3
.TP
.B PasswordGuesses
Specifies the number of tries that the user has when using
password authentication. The default is 3.
.ne 3
.TP
.B Ssh1Compatibility
Specifies whether to use SSH1 compatibility code. With this option,
.B sshd1
is executed when the client supports only SSH 1.x protocols. The argument
must be
.YN
.ne 3
.B Sshd1Path
Specifies the path to 
.B sshd1 
daemon, which is executed if the
client supports only SSH 1.x protocols. The arguments for 
.B sshd2 
are passed on to 
.B sshd1 ".

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/ssh2/sshd2_config
Contains configuration data for
.BR sshd2 .  
This file should be writable by root only, but it is recommended
(though not necessary) that it be world-readable.
.TP
.I /etc/ssh2/hostkey
Contains the private part of the host key.  This file is normally
created automatically by "make install", but can also be created
manually using
.BR ssh-keygen2 (1).
This file should only be owned by root, readable only by root, and not
accessible to others.
.TP
.I /etc/ssh2/hostkey.pub
Contains the public part of the host key.  This file is normally
created automatically by "make install", but can also be created
manually.  This file should be world-readable but writable only by
root.  Its contents should match the private part.  
.TP
.I /etc/ssh2/random_seed
This file contains a seed for the random number generator.  This file
should only be accessible by root.
.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh2/authorization
contains information on how the server will verify the identity of
an user. See 
.BR ssh2 (1)
for more information.

.SH INSTALLATION
.LP
.B Sshd2 
is normally run as root.  If it is not run as root, it can
only log in as the user it is running as, and password authentication
may not work if the system uses shadow passwords.  An alternative
host key file must also be used.
