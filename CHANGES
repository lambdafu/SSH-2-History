	* Added support for environment variable DESTDIR in
 	apps/ssh/Makefile.

	* Added --with-etcdir configuration option.

	* Added libwrap-support. (still partially untested)

	* Fixed a bug in sshd2, which caused sshd2  to go to busy-loop if
	ssh2-client was killed with, for example, kill -9 .

	* Fixed bug in sshmp.c, which caused FPE in ssh-keygen2, when it
	was compiled on Alpha with gcc.

	* Fixed little bugs here and there.

	* Added clean-up-old -target to apps/ssh/Makefile.am to allow easy
	removal of the *.old-files made by the installation.

	* Fixed a bug in initilization of variables in ssh2 (and other
	programs, which were run with user-privileges) which caused
	annoying messages with shadow passwords etc.

	* Fixed a bug in 'make install'.

	* Changed 'make install' so that it now renames the old files to
	have '.old'-trailer.

	* Earlier addition: Fixed ssh2-client to not kill all forwarded
	connections on session_close, but instead fork to background to
	wait for their completion.

	* Fixed problems with compilation.
