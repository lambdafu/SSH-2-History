1998-11-16  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Previous: Fixed a draft inconsistency in the client's version
 	  string handling. Should reduce those "Protocol error"'s.

	* Hopefully fixed the busyloop-timeout problem in scp2. Now it the
	  background ssh2 process before exiting itself.

1998-11-12  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@ssh.fi>

	* Added twofish encryption.

1998-11-12  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Previous: the #include bug in sshreadline.c, which manifested
	  itself in solaris 2.[456].x, should now be fixed. (atleast in our
	  server compiles ok).

	* Added --disable-asm flag to configure. If asm-optimizations
	  don't work, use this.

	* Added code to configure to properly add libipc for
	  bsdi2.1. In AIX 4.* utmpx is now disabled (utmpx.h is reportedly
	  broken). With HPUX _HPUX_SOURCE is now properly defined.

	* Changed handling of setsid-errors in ssh2 and sshd2. Previously
	  if setsid() call failed, ssh{2,d2} called ssh_fatal. Now, it gives
	  warning in ssh2 and logs the event in sshd2. This is the same
	  behavior as in ssh1.

	* Implemented '-r'-flag (copy directories recursively) in
	  scp2. Also cleaned up code in scp2.

1998-11-05  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Added '-1' flag, which enables scp1 compatibility. Use it as the
 	  first argument to scp2. Implemented wildcard-expansion
 	  (globbing). Currently supported wildcards are '?' and '*'.

1998-10-29  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Made progress-indicator default in scp2. Added some code to
	  display transfer-times and transfer-speed.

1998-10-29  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@ssh.fi>

	* Ssh-agent2 now more or less fully supports also requests
	  sent by ssh1 and ssh-add1. To enable ssh1 compatibility
	  in ssh-agent2 you have to start it with option -1.
	  CAUTION: ssh-agent2 works properly only with versions
	  ssh-2.0.11 and above, if run with -1 option.  Without
	  -1 option it's compatible with earlier ssh-2.0.* versions
	  too.

1998-10-21  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@ssh.fi>

	* Moved utmp update to the child.  It now seems to work
	  at least in BSD.

1998-10-19  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Added correct parsing for specifying 'user@host' on the
	  commandline. (`ssh2 user@host' equals `ssh2 -luser host')

	* Fixed --with-etcdir and --with-libwrap options in configure and
	  apps/ssh/Makefile.am.

	* Fixed calculating MAC, as it was done against the draft. Added
	  compatibility code, so that we can work with older
	  ssh-2.0.x-versions (2.0.[789]) still.

	* Implemented PasswordAuthentication and PubkeyAuthentication
	  keywords in the server. Still need to be done in the client.
	
1998-10-07  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Added code to configure, so that it detects whether compiled
	  symbols are prepended with underscore or not. With changes to the
	  assembler files, this should fix the problems with commercial
	  versions assembler-optimized crypto functions.

	* Fixed a _lot_ of buggy code in sftp2. Shouldn't seg fault
 	  anymore.

1998-10-06  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@ssh.fi>

	* Fixed -t flag in ssh2 client to have an desired 
	  effect (force pty allocation).

1998-10-02  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@ssh.fi>

	* Added O_TRUNC into scp.  Existing target files are now
	  also truncated.

1998-09-30  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@ssh.fi>

	* Added ssh_getopt.

	* Fixed command line parsing of ssh2 and sshd2.

	* Modified ssh-add2, ssh-agent2, ssh-keygen2 and scp2 to
	  use ssh_getopt2.

1998-09-17  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Added support for environment variable DESTDIR in
 	  apps/ssh/Makefile.

	* Added --with-etcdir configuration option.

	* Added libwrap-support. (still partially untested)

	* Fixed a bug in sshd2, which caused sshd2  to go to busy-loop if
	  ssh2-client was killed with, for example, kill -9 .

	* Fixed bug in sshmp.c, which caused FPE in ssh-keygen2, when it
	  was compiled on Alpha with gcc.

	* Fixed little bugs here and there.
	
1998-09-07  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Added clean-up-old -target to apps/ssh/Makefile.am to allow easy
	  removal of the *.old-files made by the installation.

	* Fixed a bug in initilization of variables in ssh2 (and other
	  programs, which were run with user-privileges) which caused
	  annoying messages with shadow passwords etc.

	* Fixed a bug in 'make install'.

1998-08-27  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Changed 'make install' so that it now renames the old files to
	  have '.old'-trailer.

1998-08-26  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Earlier addition: Fixed ssh2-client to not kill all forwarded
	  connections on session_close, but instead fork to background to
	  wait for their completion.

	* Fixed problems with compilation.
	
1998-08-06  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@ssh.fi>

	* Made ssh forward also ssh1 agent connections.

1998-08-05  Sami Lehtinen  <sjl@ssh.fi>

	* Changed ssh-add2 to fetch first key named 'id_*' when executed
	  without arguments.
	
	* Changed ssh-add2 to use ssh-askpass2 instead of ssh2-askpass.
